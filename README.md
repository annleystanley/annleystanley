### Hello! My name is Annie Stanley and I'm a recent graduate from the Lighthouse Labs Data Science program. 
#

I am excited to transition into the world of data, and am looking forward to highlighting my newfound skills here as much as possible.  I am currently back in a previous position as the manager of a busy Toronto cafe for the summer, while I search for a data job within the industry, but am hoping to still work on, and showcase meaningful projects on data!

While my github has multiple projects, in particular my [Final Project](https://github.com/annleystanley/final_project) and [Deployment Project](https://github.com/annleystanley/deployment-project) contain work that I'm proud of accomplishing under incredibly strict time restraints. I hope to re-visit both of these specific projects in the future, in order to approach them with fresh eyes and offer clearer insights.

As a pet-project, I have been looking into [dice rolls in Dungeons & Dragons games](https://github.com/annleystanley/high_rollers), and am also currently looking into starting a project based on sales data for my current employer, in order to help the cafe make data-driven business decisions in the future.

Please feel free to reach out to me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-stanley-933b8a72), or via the contact info on my [resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/cuope2ryl7c), and I'd be happy to chat!

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope that this picture of my cat will put a smile on your face!
