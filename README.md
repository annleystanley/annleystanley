### Hello! My name is Annie Stanley and I'm a recent graduate from the Lighthouse Labs Data Science program. 
#

I am excited to transition into the world of data, and am hoping to be able to highlight my newfound skills here as much as possible.  Unfortunately, I've had to take a non-industry position in the interim, and it has lead to a lack of time to be able to commit to projects at the moment.

Please feel free to reach out to me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-stanley-933b8a72), or via the contact info on my [resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/cuope2ryl7c), and I'd be happy to chat!

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope that this picture of my cat will put a smile on your face!
